													<p><p>Palau Moxo is a building of late baroque style, it was built between the gothic Barcelona Cathedral and Gaudi modernism. I copy and pasted that, belive it or not, It basically means it looks a lot like the cool parts of Barcelona we like to look around and drink in and thats why it sums up Barcelona for us. The upsatirs is a bit, well pretensious, alot of gold leaf etc, which isnt for us but the groundfloor, where the ceremony is taking place is very Barcelona, which is why we choose the venue.</p></p>

															<h4>Before</h4>
															<p>It can be a bit tricky to find as its near the gothic area of barcelona which is lots of very norrow streets/alleys so taxis dont go up around there, so you will need to to walk. Its about 3 mins from las ramblas so its not far, and with iphones its easy to follow on the satnav. You might want to leave 15 mins early to make sure you get there on time but there are a few cafe/bars in the little square in front of the venue so you can grab a strong drink while you wait. I'l see you at the bar :/</p>
														</div>
														<div class="one-half">
															<h4>During</h4>
															<p>The venue is very central and so you can come and go as you please. We've invited a few children and Eve will be there, so if you need to go back to the hotel or leave to change a nappy it's not be a problem. On the same note if you get tired or want to leave early, again everyones free to come and go as they like. And if you want a lie down in the afternoon Grandma, I SAID IF YOU WANT A LIE DOWN.. oh never mind.  </p>

													<p>If she turns up, it should go like this. The ceremony will take place at 3pm, we’re not catholic so it won’t last 4hrs, it should only take around 20 mins for Jen to list my wonderful qualities. Then there’s about an hour and half of music and aperitifs , i think they’re like sausage rolls and volovants.  Dont worry there’ll be champagne and drinks too.  Then we’ll sit down for some food and listen to lots of funny stories about me, a general rule of thumb will be if they’re nice they’re probably true and if they’re not, they will be scandalous lies that have been fabricated for comical effect. Then we throw some shapes. There will be a 3hr free bar after the meal, so hopefully you shouldn’t have to spend a penny on the day itself.</p>
