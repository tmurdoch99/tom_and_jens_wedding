So I suppose it depends on how long you want to stay out there. I know a lot of you are going out on the Mon coming back Friday but some of you might struggle to get time off work or not fancy spending any more money (sorry). There will be a lot coming from Wales too so instead of trying to organise everything it's best everyone has a look for themselves. We usually use <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net/">www.skyscanner.net</a> to search across all the airlines to find the cheapest deals. You can easily swap between airports to find the best deals. Taxis from the airport to Barcelona are about &euro;15-20 as it's a little outside the city. </p>

You can see where the venue is on the venue page if you want to stay close by but if budget is an issue find the cheapest hotel you can find and just get a taxi. If theres a big group of you villa and apartments can work out cheaper. Again <a href="http://hotels.skyscanner.com/">hotels.skyscanner.com/</a> is a good search engine for really cheap rooms, <a href="http://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a> is good. There's some 8 person apartments on there for around £30 per person per night, and they look really nice. </p>

There's an underground that I've used before which is good if you want to cross the city quickly and cheaply. Most taxi drivers, kiosk workers, ticket sales, waiters etc speak English so you shouldn't struggle too much getting around. If they don't understand you just speak louder. Usually works. The citys relatively safe, but like most major cities there are pick pockets, especially around the touristy places so just wary of that. </p>
